This is a blog of sorts, it's written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted (for free) with Github pages.

The theme is Beautiful Jekyll from [this guy](http://deanattali.com/), 
with some minor modifications for the photography whosits and whatsits.

I write these posts in Vim, and that is true pain.
