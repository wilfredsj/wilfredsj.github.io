A long time ago, I studied Mathematics, but now I work as a Quant in Hong Kong.
In my spare time, I enjoy implementing toy models, and I will demo some of them here.

Things that interest me, in no particular order:

* Procedural generation, for instance making planets or islands

* Climate modelling (somewhat related)

* Sociological simulation, especially with an evolutionary aspect

* [Photography](../photography)


Technical side:

* C++ (90% of what I do, ideally C++14)

* Scala (pleasure)

* Haskell (pain)
